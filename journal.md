# June 16th- spent 4 hours planning. 
I spent most of today setting my goals for the project. In summary, I want to make a HOTAS system that resembles the X-56 HOTAS by Logitech, since I like its design. 

Ideas for CAD design
- X and Y moving body, detect position via hall effect sensors
- Ergonomic flight stick
- Analog trigger spring mechanisms

Ideas for electronics
- Force feedback
- Use FreeJoy and any STM32F103 ("Blue Pill"). This removes the need for software. 
- Hall effect (Trigger, X-Y axis sensing)
- 2 Hat switches
- 5 buttons, 3 top, 2 sides. 
- One trigger switch. 
- OLED display
- RGB panel on back of body (backlight will be viewable.
